# UdemyProject-TrilloWebPage

Hi Everyone,

This webpage is being created as part of an Udemy course [Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More! - Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass).

This course consisted of 3 parts, with each part creating 1 webpage. **This is the second part, where the webpage was created using flexbox.** You find the other two parts in my repository ([1. Natours](https://github.com/mnstrdm/UdemyProject-NatoursWebPage), [3. Nexter](https://github.com/mnstrdm/UdemyProject-NexterWebPage)).

## What have I learned from this course?
* **Flexbox layouts: main concepts, introduction to both flex container and flex item-specific properties, advanced positioning techniques applied to a huge real-world project;**
* Tons of modern cutting-edge CSS techniques to create stunning designs and effects: clip-path, background-clip, mask-image, background-blend-mode, shape-outside, filter, backdrop-filter, object-fit, transform, column-count, hyphens, perspective, calc() and custom CSS properties;
* How CSS works behind the scenes: the cascade, specificity, inheritance, value processing, the visual formatting model, the box model, box types, positioning schemes, and stacking contexts;
* CSS architecture: The 7-1 rule, component-based design, the BEM methodology, writing reusable, maintainable, and scalable code;
* Introduction to Sass: variables, nesting, partials, imports, mixins, functions, extends, and more;
* Using Sass: setting global variables, building for reusability, architecting CSS, and managing media queries;
* The NPM ecosystem: setting up a development process to compile Sass and automatic browser reload, and creating a build process to concatenate, prefix, and compress CSS files;
* Modern responsive design: fluid grids, layout types, flexible images, using media queries to test for different screen widths, pixel densities, and touch capabilities;
* Responsive images in HTML and CSS for faster pageloads: resolution switching, density switching, art direction;
* Advanced CSS animations with @keyframes, animation and transition;
* SVG images and videos in HTML and CSS: build a background video effect;

## Requirements: 
* live server;

Please run this page on a live server.
In this project I use SVG icons like this way: `<use xlink:href=""></use>`.
Because of this usage svg links only gona work on a webserver, otherwise the icons will not appear!
